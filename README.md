# Digital Logic Design FinalProject - a.y. 2019-2020
The aim of the project is to design an HW component, based on the working-zone encoding for reducing the energy in microprocessor address buses (here is the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/736129)), to describe it in VHDL, hence to synthesize it. 

For a better understanding of the simplified version of the working-zone encoding, that has been implemented, check out the [specs](https://github.com/LorenzoMainetti/reti-logiche-2020-FinalProject/tree/master/specs) (in Italian only).

## Documentation
The documentation includes: 
- a complete description of the architecture of the component 
- the design choices that were made
- the experimental results, obtained syntethizing the component
- the analysis of several simulations on corner cases, that show the correcteness and the performances of the component
- some possible improvements

The documentation is available at the following address -> [docs](https://github.com/LorenzoMainetti/reti-logiche-2020-FinalProject/tree/master/documentation) (again in Italian only)
